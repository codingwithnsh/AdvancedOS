# AdvancedOS

## üìö Overview
AdvancedOS is an innovative desktop environment built using Python's Tkinter library. It is designed to emulate a lightweight operating system interface, complete with a taskbar, customizable desktop, and various built-in applications. This project aims to provide a functional, extendable framework for learning and experimenting with GUI-based systems.

Currently, AdvancedOS is under active development, and contributions or suggestions for improvements are welcome.
